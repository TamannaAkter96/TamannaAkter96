💫 About Me

I’m Tamanna, currently studying at United International University (UIU) and working as an Undergraduate Teaching Assistant. I’m also involved as a Research Assistant, contributing to technology-driven projects.

I’m passionate about programming and learning new technologies — currently exploring JavaScript, while I’m already skilled in C, C++, MySQL, and Python.
